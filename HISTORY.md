# AI Diary App Development History

## Project Overview
AI-powered diary application that conducts conversational interviews and generates personalized diary entries using GPT-4o-mini.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Planning & Requirements (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Requirements Gathered:**
- AI Model: GPT-4o-mini
- Conversation Flow: Specific questions to guide daily reflection
- Technology: Simple Python CLI interface
- Data Storage: JSON files
- Summary Style: First-person narrative with emotional highlights + key events

**Key Decisions:**
- Simple CLI over web app for initial version
- JSON storage for simplicity
- 10 thoughtful questions to guide conversation
- OpenAI API integration

### Stage 2: Basic Implementation (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Files Created:**
- `ai_diary.py` - Main application with conversation flow
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (openai, python-dotenv)
- `.env.example` - API key template
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- ✅ 10 thoughtful conversation questions
- ✅ AI follow-up responses during conversation
- ✅ First-person diary entry generation
- ✅ JSON storage for diary entries
- ✅ Emotional highlights + key events summarization
- ✅ CLI interface with graceful exit ('quit' command)

**Technical Details:**
- Used OpenAI's chat completions API
- Implemented conversation state management
- Created diary entry structure with timestamp, conversation, and summary
- Error handling for API failures

### Stage 3: Testing & Deployment (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed emoji encoding issues on Windows (replaced with ASCII alternatives)
- Resolved pip installation issues using `py -m ensurepip`
- Successfully installed dependencies (openai-1.98.0, python-dotenv-1.1.1)
- Configured API key in .env file

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ First question displays correctly: "Hi! How are you feeling today?"
- ✅ Ready for user interaction

### Stage 4: Voice AI Diary Implementation (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Major Upgrade:** Full voice-based diary application with real-time conversation

**Files Created:**
- `voice_diary.py` - Complete voice diary application
- `VOICE_SETUP.md` - Voice-specific setup guide
- Updated `requirements.txt` - Added audio dependencies
- Updated `README.md` - Comprehensive feature comparison

**Voice Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Push-to-talk recording (spacebar activation)
- ✅ OpenAI Whisper STT integration
- ✅ Real-time GPT-4o-mini conversation
- ✅ OpenAI TTS with Nova voice
- ✅ Advanced emotion analysis per message
- ✅ Budget controls (100 API call limit)
- ✅ Error handling with STT retry + text fallback
- ✅ JSON conversation storage with timestamps
- ✅ First-person diary generation
- ✅ Cross-platform audio support

**Technical Architecture:**
- **Voice Pipeline:** User Voice → Whisper → GPT-4o-mini → TTS → Speaker
- **Audio Libraries:** PyAudio, keyboard, pydub, numpy
- **Error Handling:** Multi-level fallbacks and retry mechanisms
- **Data Structure:** Enhanced JSON with emotion analysis and timestamps
- **Budget Management:** API usage tracking and automatic limits

**Dependencies Added:**
- pyaudio==0.2.14 (audio recording/playback)
- keyboard==0.13.5 (push-to-talk controls)
- pydub==0.25.1 (audio processing)
- numpy (audio data handling)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Voice pipeline components working
- ❌ Windows file access issues with temporary files
- ❌ Push-to-talk keyboard detection problems
- ✅ OpenAI API integrations successful

### Stage 5: Windows Compatibility Fix (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Issue Resolution:** Fixed Windows-specific problems with simplified approach

**Files Created:**
- `voice_diary_simple.py` - Windows-compatible voice diary
- Updated `.gitignore` - Added voice diary file patterns
- Updated `README.md` - Simplified voice diary instructions

**Fixes Implemented:**
- ✅ Replaced push-to-talk with ENTER key recording control
- ✅ Fixed temporary file handling conflicts on Windows
- ✅ Simplified audio playback (text fallback for Windows)
- ✅ Added threading for non-blocking audio recording
- ✅ Improved error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Reduced API call limits for budget testing
- ✅ Choice between voice ('v') and text ('t') input modes

**Technical Improvements:**
- **Threading:** Non-blocking audio recording with ENTER control
- **File Handling:** Unique UUID-based temporary file names
- **Error Recovery:** Multiple fallback mechanisms
- **User Experience:** Clear command prompts and instructions
- **Budget Control:** Reduced limits for safer testing

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ App starts successfully on Windows
- ✅ Voice recording works with ENTER controls
- ✅ Text input mode as reliable backup
- ✅ API integrations functional
- ✅ Diary generation working
- ✅ JSON file saving successful
