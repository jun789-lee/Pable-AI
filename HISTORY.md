# AI Diary App Development History

## Project Overview
AI-powered diary application that conducts conversational interviews and generates personalized diary entries using GPT-4o-mini.

## Development Stages

### Stage 1: Planning & Requirements (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Requirements Gathered:**
- AI Model: GPT-4o-mini
- Conversation Flow: Specific questions to guide daily reflection
- Technology: Simple Python CLI interface
- Data Storage: JSON files
- Summary Style: First-person narrative with emotional highlights + key events

**Key Decisions:**
- Simple CLI over web app for initial version
- JSON storage for simplicity
- 10 thoughtful questions to guide conversation
- OpenAI API integration

### Stage 2: Basic Implementation (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Files Created:**
- `ai_diary.py` - Main application with conversation flow
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies (openai, python-dotenv)
- `.env.example` - API key template
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4o-mini integration
- ✅ 10 thoughtful conversation questions
- ✅ AI follow-up responses during conversation
- ✅ First-person diary entry generation
- ✅ JSON storage for diary entries
- ✅ Emotional highlights + key events summarization
- ✅ CLI interface with graceful exit ('quit' command)

**Technical Details:**
- Used OpenAI's chat completions API
- Implemented conversation state management
- Created diary entry structure with timestamp, conversation, and summary
- Error handling for API failures

### Stage 3: Testing & Deployment (Completed)
**Date:** July 31, 2025

**Issues Resolved:**
- Fixed emoji encoding issues on Windows (replaced with ASCII alternatives)
- Resolved pip installation issues using `py -m ensurepip`
- Successfully installed dependencies (openai-1.98.0, python-dotenv-1.1.1)
- Configured API key in .env file

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Application starts successfully
- ✅ First question displays correctly: "Hi! How are you feeling today?"
- ✅ Ready for user interaction

## Current Status
**Stage:** Basic AI Text-Based Conversation & Summarization ✅ COMPLETE

**Next Planned Stages** (from original plan):
1. Speech-to-Text integration
2. Enhanced NLP models
3. Advanced conversation flow
4. Frontend/backend separation
5. Emotion analysis integration
6. Security enhancements
7. Multi-language support

## Technical Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.13.5
- **AI Model:** OpenAI GPT-4o-mini
- **Dependencies:** openai, python-dotenv
- **Storage:** JSON files
- **Interface:** CLI

## Repository Information
- **Remote:** https://github.com/jun789-lee/Pable-AI.git
- **Branch:** master
- **Status:** Ready for first deployment

## Notes for Future Development
- Consider adding conversation persistence across sessions
- Implement data export functionality
- Add diary entry search and filtering
- Consider migrating to database for better data management
- Plan mobile app version (React Native/Flutter)
- Add encryption for sensitive diary data
